# Industrial Peons DKP Priority System

**\<Industrial Peons\>** uses a unique DKP auction system for 40 man raids.  Our system discourages hoarding while ensuring no upgrade ever rots. In this guild, unlike most, we make the big decisions together democratically, so please read through this document and raise concerns you have. This document will be voted on, but it isn’t carved in stone, and if you can convince a majority of the guild, we can change any aspect of it. Our system was chosen after Peons voted to have a DKP system, but many also leaning towards a Loot Council system. So aspects of Loot Council have been incorporated into our DKP in the form of “priority classes/specs” for different items.

## How DKP is Awarded: 
We will issue different DKP values per boss. For Phase 1, the following points will be awarded :
  * 3 DKP points will be issued per each Molten Core boss.
  * 5 DKP points per each Onyxia kill

This DKP is only awarded after each raid.  It is therefore not normally possible for players to spend DKP within the raid it is earned. 5 DKP will be awarded for being present in the raid 20 minutes before the first pull. All new guild members will receive an initial seed of 40 DKP after they have completed their first raid with the Peons.

**If you sign up for a raid, but fail to show without changing your sign-up to “absent”, you will get -5 DKP for an “unexcused” absence.** If you cannot attend, please mark “absent” on the raid sign-up. It really helps us plan and makes everything go smoothly.

## DKP Logistics: 

We use MonolithDKP.  All members who ever plan to spend the DKP they earn with us should have it, and keep it up to date.

MonolithDKP addon can be downloaded at https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/monolith-dkp or with the Twitch Client. The Peggle Addon, Deadly Boss Mods, and Details! are also highly recommended when you are downloading addons as they benefit the entire raid.

To check your DKP, simply install the addon and type /dkp.  If you are morally against the idea of addons in Classic, you may also type !dkp into a raid and every officer in the raid will PM you your dkp.
To bid on an item, simply wait until the raid leader or quartermaster links it, and type: 
```
/raid !bid x
Example bid: /raid !bid 30
To cancel a bid:  /raid !bid cancel
```
Note: you will not see up to date values until an officer syncs you.  This is done before every PVE raid. Do not request updates - pushing the tables causes guild-wide lag spikes to everyone with the addon installed.  (You can avoid these by disabling the addon, but don’t forget to turn it back on(edited)

Item-by-item class/spec priority information is available for:
* [Molten Core Loot Priority](https://industrial-peons.github.io/molten-core-prio)
* [Onyxia's Lair Loot Priority](https://industrial-peons.github.io/onyxia-prio)
Concerns or suggestions regarding our loot priorities may be voiced in the #loot-discussion text channel on Discord by all members. 

## Voting: 
Everything in this system is able to be changed by a vote of the raid-ready guild members. Please contact the raid officers if you would like to propose a vote, and we will post it in #loot-information. A vote requires at least 40 raid-ready Peons to vote either way on the proposed change, and changes cannot be made mid-raid. 

If we encounter an unforeseen situation that seems outside the bounds of this system, the raid officers, while open to consultation from other players, will make the final decision in-raid.

## DKP Decay: On the first of every month (before the raid if we happen to have a raid on that day), every player loses 20% of their current DKP, rounded up, to discourage hoarding.

## Peons Loot Priority for DKP
Our system was chosen after Peons voted to have a DKP system, but many also leaning towards a Loot Council system. So aspects of Loot Council have been incorporated into our DKP in the form of “priority classes/specs” for different items. Below is linked the sheet that contains all MC/Onyxia drops, and who has priority to spend DKP on those items. Any items in BOLD get the most priority. All others are listed in no particular order.

These designations are also available for reconsideration, using the same vote mechanism explained above in the [Voting](#voting) section.


## DKP Bidding Rounds
For epic bind-on-pick-up equipment, the auction has two rounds:
#### Round 1: 
All players will place bids using the syntax above. Once bids have stagnated, the Loot Master will end when the master looter has determined that no one is left who still wants to bid. This system without time pressure encourages players to focus on the next pulls, rather than scared they’ll miss their chance to bid on gear. 
This first round is restricted to priority bids based on our loot spreadsheet (linked in [Peons Loot Priority for DKP](#peons-loot-priority-for-dkp).

*A Note About Raid-Necessary Offspecs:* If the raid’s officers decide that the MT/OT  do not require tank gear, DPS warriors may be forced to take tank gear for an automatic 5 DKP (cheaper than any other gear), or if they are under 5 DKP, all of their remaining DKP.The same goes for enhancement shamans/feral druids/spriests with healing gear.  This effectively makes tank gear loot-council. 

If a player bids up another player for an item that they are not eligible for, the auction may start again from minimum bid.  All bids on all items currently start at 20 DKP.
The method of bidding may change if it is determined to be too detrimental to raid focus.

#### Round 2: 
If there are no offers in the first round, a second round takes place.  This round obeys the same bidding format as the first, except for two key differences: there are no priority restrictions in the second round, other than that the item be an upgrade for one of the player’s roles within the raids or PVP, and the minimum bid is 10 DKP, or if they are under 10 DKP, all of their remaining DKP.

##### What if no one bids?
1. The item will be given to an enchanter to disenchant, and the result will be considered guild property

2. If the item is deemed an upgrade useful to progression appears to have been ignored due to hoarding, a player is chosen by the officers to receive this item based on whoever the item would be the largest upgrade for.  This player is charged 20% of their total DKP, rounded up, or 20 DKP, whichever is more.

## NEGATIVE DKP: 
A player cannot bid more DKP than they have.  In the event a player reaches 0 DKP, they are forbidden from placing bids unless every other player with priority for an item also reaches 0 DKP, in which all players with priority on an item /100 for the item, with the winner being charged 20 DKP and pushed into the negatives. Exceptions for this are with gear that is forced upon players, such as tanks and necessary offspecs, described above in (Peons Loot Priority)[#peons-loot-priority-for-dkp] for offspecs, and below in the [Tank Gearing](#tank-gearing) section.


## Crafting Recipe Drops & Materials
Are considered guild property and are never bid on.  They are either distributed via loot council, sold, or stored for later use.  Such stored materials and recipes can be requested by members in good standing for no cost.

## Pugs
If we are unable to completely fill a raid with Peons and need to resort to pulling in a few additional members, the loot rules will slightly change when an item is dropped that the non-guild member can use. Each non-guild raider will be permitted to roll on one tier piece and one non-tier piece throughout the raid. When a non-guild member needs the item and rolls, all other eligible guild members (MS > OS) will roll for it as well. If a DKP holding raid member wins the roll, the bidding system will initiate as normal. If a pug wins the roll, they will get the item.

## Tank Gearing
Finally, the MT has forced priority on any tank gear deemed essential to raid progression by the officers. The OT has forced secondary priority.  The MT and OT cannot refuse these upgrades, and pay either 20% of their current DKP or 20 DKP (whichever is greater) per item for them in all cases, possibly pushing them into the negatives.  Classic WoW’s raid encounters are balanced around the majority of outgoing raid damage being funneled through 1 person out of 39. It isn’t hard to do the math.  Guilds serious about progression gear up their tanks ASAP.  We are no exception.  Tank gear is generally loot-council. Do not expect to bid on it.

## Loot Council: 
We need a loot council to make this system function. The mission of this system is to outline every foreseeable event in this document, so that we can make the bid decisions all together as a guild, but a few determinations will need to be made as we go, (such as forcing upgrades upon players who wanted to hoard their DKP for another item). Most issues are solved by DKP and don’t need Loot Council in this system. These are detailed in full-depth below (so keep reading!).

`Note: We will elect our loot council in the coming couple weeks, and every loot council can be recalled through a vote (as shown in [Voting](#voting). Until then, the raid leaders (Grienudele, Boop, Tuncenna, Eryx) will serve as the loot council in the rare times that it is necessary with this system.`

## Additional Loot Information
**Legendary drops** are loot council only.  They can never be bid on, and will go specifically to the individuals who will provide the most obvious numerical advantage to our raids.  i.e., Thunderfury will go to the MT first.

### Sidegrades:  
Let DKP handle it. If somebody wins, they win, regardless of who’s bidding, or what they’re wearing.

### BoE Pieces: 
If someone in the raid needs them, the bidding system will commence as normal. If no one in raids need them, but someone in guild needs them for Mainspec, they will get the upgrade for 20 DKP. If no one needs them for Mainspec, they can be purchased for 10 DKP for either offspec or pvp. If no one needs it, it will be either sold on the AH for guild funds or sharded (whichever is deemed most valuable to the guild by the raid officers).

### Blues: 
Blues that drop and are upgrades will be rolled on by all who want them and will use them. They will cost 0 dkp. Otherwise they will go to the guild for shards or gold.

### Selling Gear:  
Individuals are strictly prohibited from attempting to turn their DKP into gold in any way, shape or form, and are similarly prohibited from buying items from raid members.

### Quest Items: 
For items that are a part of a quest chain (currently the example is Ancient Petrified Leaf and  Mature Black Dragon Sinew for hunters), if a player has one of the items, all other individuals bidding DKP on the item must also have the item.
