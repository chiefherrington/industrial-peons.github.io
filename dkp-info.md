# Industrial Peons DKP Priority System

**\<Industrial Peons\>**  uses a unique DKP auction system for 40 man raids.  Our system discourages hoarding while ensuring no upgrade ever rots. In this guild, unlike most, we make the big decisions together democratically, so please read through this document and raise concerns you have. This document will be voted on, but it isn’t carved in stone, and if you can convince a majority of the guild, we can change any aspect of it (more on that in Section 3). 

Our system was chosen after Peons voted to have a DKP system, but many also leaning towards a Loot Council system. So aspects of Loot Council have been incorporated into our DKP in the form of "priority classes/specs" for different items.

**How DKP Is Awarded:** We will issue different DKP values per boss. For Phase 3, the following points will be awarded :

  - 2 DKP points will be issued per each Molten Core boss kill. 

  - 5 DKP points per each Onyxia kill.

- 5 DKP for each BWL boss kill.

**5 DKP will be awarded for being present in the raid before the first pull.** All new guild members will receive an initial seed of 60 DKP after they have completed their first raid with the Peons.

**If you sign up for a raid, but fail to show without changing your sign-up to "absent", you will get -5 DKP for an “unexcused” absence.** If you cannot attend, please mark “absent” on the raid sign-up. It really helps us plan and makes everything go smoothly.

**DKP BASICS**

**We use MonolithDKP**.  All members who ever plan to spend the DKP they earn with us should have it, and keep it up to date.

It can be downloaded at[ https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/monolith-dkp](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/monolith-dkp) or with the Twitch Client. Deadly Boss Mods, ClassicThreatMeter, and Details! are also required addons for raiding.

To check your DKP, simply install the addon and type /dkp. You may also type !dkp into a raid and every officer in the raid will PM you your dkp.

To bid on an item, simply wait until the master looter links it, and type: 

/ra !bid x

Example bid: /ra !bid 30

To cancel a bid:  /ra !bid cancel

Note: you will not see up to date values until an officer broadcasts to you. So if you think yours isn’t accurate, contact Grienudele, Boop, Tuncenna, or Eryx.


**Item-by-item class/spec priority information** is available here. It was agreed as a guild before Phase 3 launched. This priority sheet is now locked for the phase, but guild officers have the power to remove certain priorities as we continue to progress through the content. 

The classes and specs listed next to the items are the priority. The order of the names have no bearing on the order, but bolding represents special priority over other classes listed.

**Voting:** This system is able to be changed by a vote of the raid-ready guild members. Please contact the raid officers if you would like to propose a vote, and we will post it in #💰loot-information. A vote requires at least 40 raid-ready Peons to vote either way on the proposed change, and changes cannot be made mid-raid. 

If we encounter an unforeseen situation that seems outside the bounds of this system, the raid officers, while open to consultation from other players, will make the final decision in-raid.

**DKP Decay: **On the first of every month, every player loses 20% of their current DKP, rounded up, to discourage hoarding.

__**AUCTION INFORMATION**__

**For epic bind-on-pick-up equipment, the auction has two rounds:**

**Round 1:** All players will place bids using the syntax above. Once bids have stagnated, the Loot Master will end the rolls in an auction style fashion (Going once.. Going Twice... Sold to Cariad). This first round is restricted to "sane" rolls, i.e., a hunter bidding on a bow would be “sane”, whereas a warrior bidding on it would not; additionally, off-spec classes like DPS warriors cannot attempt to buy tank gear during this round - if the raid’s officers decide that the MT/OT  do not require tank gear, DPS warriors may be forced to take tank gear for an automatic 5 DKP, or if they are under 5 DKP, all of their remaining DKP.  This effectively makes tank gear loot-council. If a player bids up another player for an item that they are not eligible for, the auction may start again from minimum bid.  All bids on all items from BWL currently start at 20 DKP, and 10 DKP from MC & Onyxia.

*The method of bidding may change if it is determined to be too detrimental to raid focus.*

**Round 2**: If there are no offers in the first round, a second round takes place.  This round obeys the same bidding format as the first, except for two key differences: there are no priority restrictions in the second round, other than that the item be an upgrade for one of the player’s roles within the raids or PVP, and the minimum bid is 10 DKP, or if they are under 10 DKP, all of their remaining DKP. In the case of MC/Onyxia, this would start at 5 DKP.

**If there are no offers on the second round, one of two things will happen:**(edited)

1. The item will be given to an enchanter to disenchant, and the result will be considered guild property

2. If the item is deemed an upgrade useful to progression appears to have been ignored due to hoarding, a player is chosen by the officers to receive this item based on whoever the item would be the largest upgrade for.  This player is still charged 20% of their total DKP, rounded up.

**NEGATIVE DKP**

A player cannot bid more DKP than they have.  In the event a player reaches 0 DKP, they are forbidden from placing bids unless every other player with priority for an item also reaches 0 DKP, in which all players with priority on an item /100 for the item, with the winner being charged 20 DKP and pushed into the negatives.

**CRAFTING RECIPE DROPS AND CRAFTING MATERIALS**

Are considered guild property and are never bid on.  They are either distributed via loot council, sold, or stored for later use.  Such stored materials and recipes can be requested by members in good standing for no cost.

**PUGS**

If we are unable to completely fill a raid with Peons and need to resort to pulling in a few additional members, the loot rules will slightly change when an item is dropped that the non-guild member can use. Each non-guild raider will be permitted to roll on one tier piece and one non-tier piece throughout the raid. When a non-guild member needs the item and rolls, all other eligible guild members (MS > OS) will roll for it as well. If a DKP holding raid member wins the roll, the bidding system will initiate as normal.

**TANK GEARING**

Finally, the MT has forced priority on any tank gear deemed essential to raid progression by the officers. The OT has forced secondary priority.  The MT and OT cannot refuse these upgrades, and pay either 20% of their current DKP or 20 DKP (whichever is greater) per item for them in all cases, possibly pushing them into the negatives.  Classic WoW’s raid encounters are balanced around the majority of outgoing raid damage being funneled through 1 person out of 39. It isn’t hard to do the math.  Guilds serious about progression gear up their tanks ASAP.  We are no exception.  Tank gear is generally loot-council. Do not expect to bid on it.

**ADDITIONAL LOOT INFORMATION**

**Legendary drops** are loot council only.  They can never be bid on, and will go specifically to the individuals who will provide the most obvious numerical advantage to our raids.  i.e., Thunderfury will go to the MT first.

**Sidegrades:**  Let DKP handle it. If somebody wins, they win, regardless of who’s bidding, or what they’re wearing.

**Selling Gear:**  Individuals are strictly prohibited from attempting to turn their DKP into gold in any way, shape or form, and are similarly prohibited from buying items from raid members.

**Quest Items:** For items that are a part of a quest chain (currently the example is Ancient Petrified Leaf and  Mature Black Dragon Sinew for hunters), if a player has one of the items, all other individuals bidding DKP on the item must also have the item.
